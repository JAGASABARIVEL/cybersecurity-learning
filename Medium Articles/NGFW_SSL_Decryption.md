Encryption has revolutionized online security, but it also gives cyber threats a secret passage to infiltrate networks. Traditional firewalls struggle with encrypted traffic, leaving organizations vulnerable. Enter Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs), which add advanced SSL/TLS decryption capabilities to expose hidden dangers while preserving the integrity of encrypted communication.

In this article, I explore:

Why inspecting encrypted traffic matters: Balancing security with confidentiality.
The SSL/TLS decryption process in NGFWs: A detailed breakdown of the five-step process.
Challenges and trade-offs: How NGFWs mitigate performance and privacy concerns.
Learn how NGFWs act as intermediaries during encrypted communications, leveraging intelligent inspection and decryption techniques to safeguard against modern threats.
